Way to distinguish the two: Concept Nodes can be instantiated, while Property Nodes can't; "X is a (instance of) [[Convex Function]] (concept)" is good, but you can't say "X is a [[Convexity of Function]]" isn't.

Concept parent node ([[Function]]) + Property of concept parent node ([[Convexity of Function]]) => Concept child node ([[Convex Function]])
