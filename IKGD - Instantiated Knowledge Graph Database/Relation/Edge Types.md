"child" member of a set; comply to description of the concept of the set.



"similar" -- a very weak relation edge. the edge should denote on what axis are the connected nodes similar.



"reference" weakest link can be unliked-reference that get recorded but not shown; similar to notabase; Whenever a text is slected, thre should be an option to generate all unliked and linked reference for it (unlike here where only nodes have them shown)



Should we seperate "between node relation" from "in node relation" (such as "therefore" which connects deduction steps of a proof)? Definately.
