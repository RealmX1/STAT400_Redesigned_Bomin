an idea I find interesting -- came up when designing graph representation:
I'm thinking about creating a type of motivation nodes as source node. each conceptual knowledge should have a motivation node explicitly describing for what sake (in order to model what kind of event) is this conceptual knowledge generated/derived. Motivation nodes on the lower end of the knowledge tree would follow 

From this it seems that statistics is one of those disciplines where we can construct motivation tree which could serve as another guideline in the learning process, the order of which might be different from the one most traditional statistics teaching material proposes.

it is still a very crude idea though
