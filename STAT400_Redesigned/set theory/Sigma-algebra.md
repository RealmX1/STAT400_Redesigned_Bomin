\begin{def}
a σ-algebra (also σ-field) on a set X
is a nonempty collection Σ of subsets of X closed under [[Complement (set theory)]], countable [[Union (set theory)]]s, and countable [[Intersection (set theory)]]s.
in probability theory, it is interpreted as **the collection of events which can be assigned probabilities.**

Also, Borel Field for the set of all real numbers:
