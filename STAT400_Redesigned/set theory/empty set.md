\begin{def}
a set with no element in it
formal definition is the set of elements which doesn't have identity property: $\emptyset = \{x:x\ne x\}$
\end{def}

\begin{notation}
$\emptyset$
\end{notation}

\begin{instantiation}

\end{instantiation}

note that since  empty set itself has identity, $\{\emptyset\}$ is not an empty set; instead, it is a set containing the empty set as its sole element.
