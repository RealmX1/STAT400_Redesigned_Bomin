\begin{instantiation}
instantiation on an arbitrary set $X$
1. **Trivial Sigma-Algebra**: For any set $X$, there is always the trivial sigma-algebra, which contains only the empty set and the set $X$ itself. This is the smallest sigma-algebra possible on $X$.
    
2. **Discrete Sigma-Algebra**: Conversely, there is the discrete sigma-algebra, which contains all possible subsets of $X$. This is the largest sigma-algebra on $X$ and is also known as the power set of $X$.
